('breast biopsy', 'Is Breast Biopsy Painful?', 'Discomfort is common, but significant pain is usually managed with local anesthesia or sedation.'),
('breast biopsy', 'What is done before the Breast biopsy?', 'Before the biopsy, your doctor may conduct imaging tests (like mammography or ultrasound) to locate the suspicious area. Blood tests may be done to assess clotting factors.'),
('breast biopsy', 'What is done after the Breast biopsy?', 'After the biopsy, pressure may be applied to the biopsy site to control bleeding. You may be given a bandage or dressing. You\'ll receive instructions on caring for the biopsy site and managing any discomfort.'),
('breast biopsy', 'What happens during a Breast Biopsy?', 'During the biopsy, a small sample of breast tissue is removed using a needle (core needle biopsy) or through a small incision (surgical biopsy). Local anesthesia is used to numb the area. Imaging guidance (such as ultrasound or mammography) may be used to precisely target the biopsy site.'),
('breast biopsy', 'Who is going to be performing the process?', 'A radiologist, breast surgeon, or interventional radiologist typically performs breast biopsies.'),
('breast biopsy', 'How long should I have to stay in the hospital?', 'Breast biopsies are usually performed on an outpatient basis, and you can typically go home the same day.'),
('breast biopsy', 'When do I get my Results?  ', 'Results are typically available within a few days to a week after the biopsy. Your doctor will discuss the findings with you and recommend appropriate next steps.'),
('breast biopsy', 'What are the Risks involved?', 'Risks of breast biopsy include temporary bruising, bleeding, infection, and rarely, damage to nearby structures. There\'s also a small risk of complications related to anesthesia. It\'s important to follow post-biopsy instructions and contact your doctor if you experience any unusual symptoms after the procedure.'),
('oral biopsy', 'Is Oral Biopsy Painful?', 'Discomfort is common, but significant pain is rare. Local anesthesia is used to numb the area.'),
('oral biopsy', 'What is done before the Oral biopsy?', 'Typically, a review of medical history and medications. Sometimes, blood tests may be done.'),
('oral biopsy', 'What is done after the Oral biopsy?', 'You may be instructed to apply ice, take pain relievers, and avoid certain foods. Follow post-procedure care instructions.'),
('oral biopsy', 'What happens during a Oral Biopsy?', 'A small piece of tissue is removed from the mouth or oral cavity using a specialized tool or scalpel. Local anesthesia is used to minimize discomfort.'),
('oral biopsy', 'Who is going to be performing the process?', 'A Radiologist, periodontist, or ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat) specialist typically performs oral biopsies.'),
('oral biopsy', 'How long should I have to stay in the hospital?', 'Oral biopsies are often done on an outpatient basis, and you can usually go home the same day.'),
('oral biopsy', 'When do I get my Results?  ', 'It usually takes 3-6 days to receive biopsy results, depending solely on the complexity of the Oral biopsy and laboratory processing time. At CION Cancer Clinics, we are committed to providing you with the biopsy results as soon as possible.'),
('oral biopsy', 'What are the Risks involved?', 'Risks include bleeding, infection, pain, and rarely, nerve damage. Follow post-biopsy care instructions to minimize risks.'),
('liver biopsy', 'Is Liver Biopsy Painful?', 'During a liver biopsy, you will receive a local anesthetic to numb the area where the biopsy needle will be inserted. You may feel some pressure or discomfort during the procedure, but significant pain is uncommon.'),
('liver biopsy', 'What is done before the Liver biopsy?', 'Your doctor may instruct you to refrain from eating or drinking for a certain period of time before the biopsy. Also, it is advised to temporarily stop taking certain medications before liver biopsy, especially those that can affect blood clotting.'),
('liver biopsy', 'What is done after the Liver biopsy?', 'After the biopsy, you will be monitored for a few hours to check for any signs of complications such as bleeding or pain. Vital signs like blood pressure and heart rate will be observed. You will likely be advised to rest for the remainder of the day and avoid strenuous activities for a few days.'),
('liver biopsy', 'What happens during a Liver Biopsy?', 'During a liver biopsy, you will lie on your back or side. The area on your abdomen where the biopsy needle will be inserted is cleaned and numbed with a local anesthetic. Using ultrasound or CT scan guidance for precision, a thin biopsy needle is then inserted through the skin into the liver to obtain a small tissue sample.'),
('liver biopsy', 'Who is going to be performing the process?', 'A liver biopsy is typically performed by a radiologist or a gastroenterologist, both of whom are specialized in these procedures. They are trained to use imaging techniques to guide the biopsy needle accurately into the liver.'),
('liver biopsy', 'How long should I have to stay in the hospital?', 'Most liver biopsies are performed on an outpatient basis, meaning you can go home the same day after a brief observation period (usually a few hours). Rarely, if there are concerns about bleeding or other complications, you may need to stay overnight for observation.'),
('liver biopsy', 'When do I get my Results?  ', 'It usually takes 3-6 days to receive biopsy results, depending solely on the complexity of the Liver biopsy and laboratory processing time. At CION Cancer Clinics, we are committed to providing you with the biopsy results as soon as possible.'),
('liver biopsy', 'What are the Risks involved?', 'Although complications are rare, potential risks of a liver biopsy include bleeding, infection, and injury to nearby organs such as the gallbladder or lung.'),
('lung biopsy', 'Is Lung Biopsy Painful?', 'The procedure is usually performed under local anesthesia, so discomfort is minimal. However, some patients may experience pressure or mild pain during the biopsy.'),
('lung biopsy', 'What is done before the lung biopsy?', 'Your doctor may instruct you to refrain from eating or drinking for a certain period of time before the biopsy. Also, it is advised to temporarily stop taking certain medications before lung biopsy, especially those that can affect blood clotting.'),
('lung biopsy', 'What is done after the lung biopsy?', 'Immediately after the biopsy, you will be closely monitored for a few hours to check for any complications such as bleeding or pneumothorax (collapsed lung). Post-procedure imaging (like chest X-rays) may be performed to assess lung status.'),
('lung biopsy', 'What happens during a lung Biopsy?', 'During the biopsy, a needle or biopsy instrument is guided into the lung tissue through the chest wall or airways (bronchoscopy) to obtain a sample of the abnormal tissue. This is often done under imaging guidance (CT or ultrasound) for accuracy.'),
('lung biopsy', 'Who is going to be performing the process?', 'The biopsy is typically performed by a radiologist (for CT-guided biopsies) or a pulmonologist (for bronchoscopy-guided biopsies), with assistance from trained nurses and technologists.'),
('lung biopsy', 'How long should I have to stay in the hospital?', 'Most patients can go home the same day after a few hours of observation, assuming no complications occur. In rare cases where complications arise, an overnight hospital stay may be necessary.'),
('lung biopsy', 'When do I get my Results?', 'It usually takes 3-6 days to receive biopsy results, depending solely on the complexity of the lung biopsy and laboratory processing time. At CION Cancer Clinics, we are committed to providing you with the biopsy results as soon as possible.'),
('lung biopsy', 'What are the Risks involved?', 'Risks include bleeding, pneumothorax (collapsed lung), infection, and rarely, damage to nearby structures like blood vessels or airways. Your healthcare team takes precautions to minimize these risks during the procedure.');
